## How To Use:
1. Run the application 'Instagram Profile Bomber'. <br>
If antivirus warns you about this 'risky' app, just whitelist the application. Don't worry, there is no virus, can see the source code yourself.

    In case of Windows Defender
    1. Click 'More Info'

        ![moreinfo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64152220/91061343-a6531b00-e65e-11ea-811a-1055e7ac300a.jpg)

1. Terminal will appear. <br>
Answer the first question "Login using Facebook?" with 'y' for yes and 'n' for No.

1. Insert your Instagram email and password. <br>
Again, don't worry I will not save the credentials anywhere, can see the source code yourself.

1. Insert The Instagram profile username that you want to bomb.

1. Chrome window will open and let it be, you also can let it run on the background.

1. DONE!

## Down side
1. Cannot do on private profile that you are not followed yet. (obviously)

1. The browser must be open full screen all the time during the process.

1. It can only handle profile with 40 post maximum. If profile with posts over 40, it will just likes the latest 40 post. <br>
( Will be fixed soon. )

As far as I tried, there will be no risk of banning or temporary banning as long as you are not using it excessively.
<br>
<br>
Happy Bombing!
